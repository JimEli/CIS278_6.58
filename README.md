## Exercise 6.58 
### Computer-Assisted Instruction: Reducing Student Fatigue

Reducing Student Fatigue. One problem in CAI environments is student fatigue. This can be reduced by varying the computer’s responses to hold the student’s attention. Modify the program of Exercise 6.57 so that various comments are displayed for each answer as follows:
Possible responses to a correct answer:
```Text
    Very good!
    Excellent!
    Nice work!
    Keep up the good work!
```
Possible responses to an incorrect answer :
```Text
    No, Please try again.
    Wrong. Try once more.
    Don’t give up.
    No. Keep trying.
```
Use random-number generation to choose a number from 1 to 4 that will be used to select one of the four appropriate responses to each correct or incorrect answer. Use a switch statement to issue the responses.
